# DSND-P1 : Write a Data Science Blog Post

### Project Details

This is my work for the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025) (DSND) Project 1. Write a Data Science Blog Post. I use [Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) as dataset and choose the following three questions :

1. What are the top 5 popular languages from 2018 to 2019 ?
2. What is the most popular version control tool in 2018 ? What percentage does it take ?

3. What is the most popular IDE from 2017 to 2019 ?



### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install and configure Python 3 environment 
3. Install the following dependency
   1. Pandas
   2. Numpy
   3. Matplotlib
   4. seaborn
   5. IPython
4. Clone this repository to a local folder.
5. Download 2017, 2018 and 2019 full data set from [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey):

6. Unzip and place the folders in the local repository which cloned from step 1, say in the `DSND-P1-Write-A-Data-Science-Blog-Post/` folder. The file hierarchy is similar as follows :

```
DSND-P1-Write-A-Data-Science-Blog-Post/
|- developer_survey_2017
|  |- survey_results_public.csv
|  |- survey_results_schema.csv
|              ...
|- developer_survey_2018
|  |- survey_results_public.csv
|  |- survey_results_schema.csv
|              ...
|- developer_survey_2019
   |- survey_results_public.csv
   |- survey_results_schema.csv
               ...
```



### Instructions

2. Open jupyter notebook `write_a_data_science_blog_post.ipynb`
4. Execute all code cells



### Blog Post

I posted a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@raymonduchen/trends-or-illusions-stack-overflow-survey-discovery-e2add81da3ff) to communicate my findings with stakeholders.
